## Introduction
The objective of this project is to develop an electronic card on which we have integrated a gas sensor manufactured in the clean room at AIME (Inter-University Micro-Nano Electronics Laboratory). The electronic board includes an analog circuit for conditioning the sensor signal, a microcontroller (ESP32) for receiving the conditioned sensor signal and communicating with the other components on the board, a LoRa module for sending sensor data over a LoRa network using Chirpstack, and a buzzer to alert when a gas concentration threshold has been exceeded.
